# WOWYCO(Walk Out With Your Clock Out!)

<p>WOWYCO is a terminal application, written in Ruby language, that allows the user to enter in their clock-in and clock-out times, then returns the time in which they can clock out based on an 8hr work day.</p>

## Motivation

<p>I created this application because I am constantly clocking into work at different times each day and often taking a different duration of lunch. I saw calculating my hours in order to find what time I could clock out for the day to be rather inconvenient and annoying. What better way to test out my newly acquired Ruby skills than this simple, yet useful application!</p>
